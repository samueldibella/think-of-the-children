Quotes:

	radiation Algorithm plot:
		generate wind direction.
		spawn a couple of radiation generating tiles, not near player.
		
		flat chance for wind to shift by degrees, or fall off, and pick up anywhere (4-5 turn time)
		radiation disperses by wind.
		
	geiger counter plot:
		bfxr noise repeats more often per second higher rad levels in square.
